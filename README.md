[rholang.aotb](https://keybase.io/team/rholang.aotb) team
 - founding member: [Gary on Keybase](https://keybase.io/garycoulter); ask him about getting into the keybase group.
 - `#general` is the main channel (as in all keybase teams)
 - subteams
   - logs - experiment to capture every keybase message Gary has access to (possible privacy issue...)
   - testing

idea: use team folder for publishing instead
